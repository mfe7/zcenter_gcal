# zcenter_gcal
Python script to generate Google Calendar events from MIT Z Center webpage

* [Z Center Schedule (PDF)](http://web.mit.edu/athletics/www/recschedule.pdf)

* The Google calendar is posted here: (https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=OGQwaW1xcHFsZzZlMmdrNW8yMXJpN21xanNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)

To use, run `$ python quickstart.py`.
It will prompt you to log into your google account, in order to setup the credentials you need to add events to the calendar.

If you'd rather create your own version, you can change the calendar ID in `quickstart.py` and it should work similarly.
